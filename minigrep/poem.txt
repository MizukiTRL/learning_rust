The leaves are changing,
Falling from the trees,
A symphony of colors,
Dancing in the breeze.

The air is crisp and cool,
With a hint of frost,
As the earth prepares for winter,
And all things come to rest.

But in this moment of stillness,
There is beauty to behold,
In the fiery hues of autumn,
And the stories yet untold.
